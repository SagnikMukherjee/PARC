    "question": "You have a right triangle with three sides, each measuring 10 centimeters (cm), 8 centimeters (cm), and 6 centimeters (cm). What is the length of the radius of the circumscribed circle?",
    "ground_truth_solution": "The circumscribed circle around a right triangle is also known as the circumcircle. The radius of this circle is called the circumradius. For a right triangle, the circumradius (R) can be found using the formula:\n\nR = hypotenuse / 2\n\nIn a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side, which is opposite the right angle. In this case, we have three sides: 10 cm, 8 cm, and 6 cm. To determine which side is the hypotenuse, we need to check if the triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the other two sides.\n\nLet's check if 10 cm is the hypotenuse:\n\n8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100\n10^2 = 100\n\nSince 100 = 100, the side measuring 10 cm is indeed the hypotenuse.\n\nNow we can use the formula to find the circumradius:\n\nR = hypotenuse / 2\nR = 10 cm / 2\nR = 5 cm\n\nThe length of the radius of the circumscribed circle around this right triangle is 5 centimeters.",

    "ground_truth_solution": "To calculate the surface area of the new shape, we need to consider the original surface area of the cube and then subtract the areas of the faces that were removed and add the areas of the new faces that were created by digging out the smaller cubes.\n\nThe original cube has 6 faces, each with an area of \\(10 \\text{ cm} \\times 10 \\text{ cm} = 100 \\text{ cm}^2\\). So the total surface area of the original cube is \\(6 \\times 100 \\text{ cm}^2 = 600 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nEach face of the original cube has a smaller cube dug out from its center. The smaller cube has an edge length of 2 cm, so each face of the smaller cube has an area of \\(2 \\text{ cm} \\times 2 \\text{ cm} = 4 \\text{ cm}^2\\). Since each smaller cube has 6 faces, the total area removed from each face of the original cube is \\(6 \\times 4 \\text{ cm}^2 = 24 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nHowever, we must consider that each small cube is dug out from the center of each face of the larger cube, so only one face of each small cube is actually removed from the larger cube's surface area. Therefore, for each face of the original cube, we subtract the area of one face of the smaller cube, which is \\(4 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nSince there are 6 faces on the original cube, the total area removed is \\(6 \\times 4 \\text{ cm}^2 = 24 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nNow, we need to add the area of the sides of the dug-out cubes that are now part of the surface. Each small cube has 5 faces contributing to the new surface area (since one face is the hole itself). Each of these faces has an area of \\(4 \\text{ cm}^2\\), so the total area added for each small cube is \\(5 \\times 4 \\text{ cm}^2 = 20 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nSince there is one small cube dug out from each face of the original cube, and there are 6 faces, the total area added is \\(6 \\times 20 \\text{ cm}^2 = 120 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nFinally, we calculate the total surface area of the new shape by subtracting the area removed and adding the area added to the original surface area:\n\nOriginal surface area: \\(600 \\text{ cm}^2\\)\nArea removed: \\(-24 \\text{ cm}^2\\)\nArea added: \\(+120 \\text{ cm}^2\\)\n\nTotal surface area of the new shape: \\(600 \\text{ cm}^2 - 24 \\text{ cm}^2 + 120 \\text{ cm}^2 = 696 \\text{ cm}^2\\)\n\nSo the surface area of the new shape is \\(696 \\text{ cm}^2\\).",

So the total number of pieces taken by the students is:\n7 students * 12 pieces/student = 84 pieces\n\nThere were also 5 pieces left over before the classmate came in. So the total number of pizza slices was:\n84 pieces (taken by students) + 5 pieces (left over) = 89 pieces\n\nNow, Seoyoon's classmate joins, making the total number of people to share the pizza 8. We need to divide the 89 pieces among 8 people.\n\n89 pieces / 8 people = 11 pieces/person with 1 piece remaining\n\nSo, after redistributing the pizza slices to 8 people, there will be 1 piece remaining.",

When the line is rearranged in ascending order, these 12 people will now be in front of him. So, Youngchul will be the 13th person from the front.\n\nSince there are 22 people in total, to find Youngchul's position from the back in ascending order, we subtract his position from the front (13th) from the total number of people (22):\n\n22 - 13 = 9\n\nTherefore, Youngchul will be the 10th person when counted from the back in ascending order.",

    "ground_truth_solution": "To find the area of the smaller rhombus, we first need to determine the side length of the larger rhombus.\n\nSince the larger rhombus is the largest that can fit inside the circle, its vertices will touch the circumference of the circle. This means that the diagonals of the rhombus are equal to the diameter of the circle. The diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so in this case, it is 2 * 10 cm = 20 cm.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if the larger rhombus has diagonals of 20 cm each, they will intersect at the center of the rhombus and form four right-angled triangles, each with legs that are half the length of the diagonals (10 cm each).\n\nThe area of the larger rhombus can be found using the formula for the area of a rhombus, which is (d1 * d2) / 2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. So, the area of the larger rhombus is (20 cm * 20 cm) / 2 = 200 cm\u00b2.\n\nNow, let's find the side length of the smaller rhombus. The smaller rhombus is formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the larger rhombus. This means that each side of the smaller rhombus is half the length of the diagonal of the larger rhombus, which is 10 cm.\n\nThe smaller rhombus is also a rhombus, so its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other and bisect the angles of the rhombus. Since the diagonals of the larger rhombus are equal, the smaller rhombus will be a square, with each side equal to 10 cm.\n\nThe area of the smaller rhombus (which is a square) can be found using the formula for the area of a square, which is side^2. So, the area of the smaller rhombus is 10 cm * 10 cm = 100 cm\u00b2.",

    "ground_truth_solution": "Let's start by figuring out the age difference between the older brother and the younger brother. When the older brother is 10, the younger brother is 7, which means there is a 3-year age difference between them.\n\nNow, let's find out the age of the younger brother when the older brother is 12. Since there is a 3-year age difference, the younger brother will be 12 - 3 = 9 years old when the older brother is 12.\n\nNext, we need to find out the age of the mother when the younger brother is 9. We know that when the younger brother is 5, the mother is 32 years old. So, to find the mother's age when the younger brother is 9, we need to add the difference in years to the mother's age when the younger brother was 5.\n\nThe difference in years between the younger brother being 5 and being 9 is 9 - 5 = 4 years.\n\nSo, the mother's age when the younger brother is 9 will be 32 (her age when the younger brother was 5) + 4 (the number of years that have passed) = 32 + 4 = 36 years old.\n\nFinally, we can find the sum of the ages of the younger brother and the mother when the older brother is 12 (and the younger brother is 9):\n\nYounger brother's age = 9 years old\nMother's age = 36 years old\n\nSum of their ages = 9 + 36 = 45 years old\n\nSo, the sum of the ages of the younger brother and the mother when the older brother is 12 years old is 45 years.",

This is a simple selection problem, and there are 4 ways to choose 1 king from 4 people.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to select 2 subjects and 1 king, we multiply the number of ways to select the subjects by the number of ways to select the king:\n\nTotal ways = Ways to select subjects * Ways to select king\nTotal ways = 15 * 4\nTotal ways = 60\n\nTherefore, there are 60 different ways to select 2 subjects and 1 king from 6 people.",

    "ground_truth_solution": "To create a three-digit integer, we need to select 3 different numbers from the 6 available (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and arrange them in a sequence where the first digit cannot be 0 (since that would make it a two-digit number).\n\nFirst, we select 3 different numbers from the 6 available. This can be done in \\( \\binom{6}{3} \\) ways, which is the number of combinations of 6 things taken 3 at a time. The formula for combinations is \\( \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\), where \\( n! \\) denotes the factorial of n.\n\nSo, \\( \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20 \\) ways.\n\nNow, for each of these combinations, we need to arrange them into a three-digit number. However, we must remember that the first digit cannot be 0. So, for each combination, we have two cases:\n\n1. If the combination includes the number 0, we have 2 choices for the first digit (any of the other two numbers), and then 2 choices for the second digit (the remaining number or 0), and finally 1 choice for the last digit (whichever number is left). This gives us \\( 2 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4 \\) arrangements for each combination that includes 0.\n\n2. If the combination does not include the number 0, we have 3 choices for the first digit, 2 choices for the second digit, and 1 choice for the last digit. This gives us \\( 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\) arrangements for each combination that does not include 0.\n\nTo find out how many of the 20 combinations include the number 0, we can calculate it as follows: We have 1 choice for the number 0, and then we need to choose 2 more numbers from the remaining 5 numbers. This can be done in \\( \\binom{5}{2} \\) ways.\n\n\\( \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10 \\) ways.\n\nSo, there are 10 combinations that include the number 0, and each of these can be arranged in 4 ways, giving us \\( 10 \\times 4 = 40 \\) three-digit numbers.\n\nThe remaining \\( 20 - 10 = 10 \\) combinations do not include the number 0, and each of these can be arranged in 6 ways, giving us \\( 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\) three-digit numbers.\n\nAdding these together, we get \\( 40 + 60 = 100 \\) three-digit integers that can be created by pressing 3 of the 6 buttons on the calculator.",

    "ground_truth_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of the 2-meter sections of both the doll and the tree and then add those weights together.\n\nFirst, let's find the weight per meter for both the doll and the tree:\n\nThe doll is 5 meters long and weighs 29/8 kilograms. To find the weight per meter, we divide the total weight by the total length:\nWeight per meter (doll) = Total weight (doll) / Total length (doll)\nWeight per meter (doll) = (29/8) kg / 5 m\nWeight per meter (doll) = (29/8) * (1/5) kg/m\nWeight per meter (doll) = 29/40 kg/m\n\nThe tree is 4 meters long and weighs 2.8 kilograms. To find the weight per meter, we divide the total weight by the total length:\nWeight per meter (tree) = Total weight (tree) / Total length (tree)\nWeight per meter (tree) = 2.8 kg / 4 m\nWeight per meter (tree) = 0.7 kg/m\n\nNow, let's find the weight of a 2-meter section of both the doll and the tree:\n\nWeight of 2-meter section (doll) = Weight per meter (doll) * 2 m\nWeight of 2-meter section (doll) = (29/40) kg/m * 2 m\nWeight of 2-meter section (doll) = 29/20 kg\n\nWeight of 2-meter section (tree) = Weight per meter (tree) * 2 m\nWeight of 2-meter section (tree) = 0.7 kg/m * 2 m\nWeight of 2-meter section (tree) = 1.4 kg\n\nFinally, let's add the weights of the 2-meter sections together:\n\nTotal weight of 2-meter sections = Weight of 2-meter section (doll) + Weight of 2-meter section (tree)\nTotal weight of 2-meter sections = (29/20) kg + 1.4 kg\n\nTo add these together, we need to convert 1.4 kg to a fraction with the same denominator as 29/20, which is 20:\n\n1.4 kg = 1.4 * (20/20) kg\n1.4 kg = (1.4 * 20) / 20 kg\n1.4 kg = 28/20 kg\n\nNow we can add the two fractions:\n\nTotal weight of 2-meter sections = (29/20) kg + (28/20) kg\nTotal weight of 2-meter sections = (29 + 28) / 20 kg\nTotal weight of 2-meter sections = 57/20 kg\n\nTo convert this to a mixed number, we divide 57 by 20:\n\n57 \u00f7 20 = 2 with a remainder of 17\n\nSo, 57/20 kg is equal to 2 kg and 17/20 kg.\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the 2-meter sections of the doll and the tree together is 2 kg and 17/20 kg.",

    "ground_truth_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to use Euler's formula for polyhedra, which states that for any convex polyhedron:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nFrom the given information, we have:\n\nV + F + C = 50\n\nHowever, the term \"corners\" is a bit ambiguous, as corners typically refer to vertices in the context of polyhedra. Assuming that \"corners\" is a mistaken term and should be \"edges\" (E), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nV + E + F = 50\n\nNow, let's use Euler's formula to find the relationship between V, E, and F for the prism:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for E:\n\nE = V + F - 2\n\nSince we know that V + E + F = 50, we can substitute E in the above equation:\n\nE = (50 - E) - 2\n\nNow, let's solve for E:\n\nE = 50 - E - 2\n2E = 48\nE = 24\n\nSo, the prism has 24 edges.\n\nNow, let's find the number of edges of the pyramid that has the same base shape as the prism. A pyramid has one less edge on the base than the prism because the base of the pyramid is the same as one of the faces of the prism, and the rest of the edges of the pyramid come from the vertices of the base to the apex.\n\nLet's denote the number of edges on the base of the prism as B. Since a prism has two congruent bases, the total number of edges on the bases of the prism is 2B. The remaining edges of the prism are the ones that connect the corresponding vertices of the two bases, which is equal to the number of vertices on one base (also B).\n\nSo, for the prism, we have:\n\nE (total edges of prism) = 2B (edges on bases) + B (vertical edges)\n24 = 2B + B\n24 = 3B\nB = 24 / 3\nB = 8\n\nThe base of the prism has 8 edges, which means the base is an octagon.\n\nNow, for the pyramid with an octagonal base, the number of edges will be the number of edges on the base (8) plus the number of edges from the vertices of the base to the apex (also 8, since there is one edge from each vertex of the base to the apex).\n\nTherefore, the pyramid has 8 (base edges) + 8 (edges to apex) = 16 edges.",

The number 72 is a composite number that can be factored into prime factors as 72 = 2^3 * 3^2. This means that for a number to be a multiple of 72, it must be a multiple of both 2^3 (which is 8) and 3^2 (which is 9).\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. A multiple of 8: For a number to be a multiple of 8, its last three digits must be divisible by 8. In the number A4461B, the last three digits are \"61B\". We need to find a value for B such that 61B is divisible by 8.\n\n2. A multiple of 9: For a number to be a multiple of 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. In the number A4461B, the sum of the digits is A + 4 + 4 + 6 + 1 + B. We need to find values for A and B such that this sum is divisible by 9.\n\nLet's start with the first condition:\n\nFor 61B to be divisible by 8, we can test the possible values for B (0 through 9) and see which one makes 61B divisible by 8. We can do this by checking the divisibility of the numbers 610, 611, 612, ..., 619 by 8.\n\nUpon checking, we find that 616 is divisible by 8 (since 616 / 8 = 77). Therefore, B must be 6.\n\nNow let's move on to the second condition:\n\nThe sum of the digits is A + 4 + 4 + 6 + 1 + B = A + 15 + B. Since B is 6, the sum becomes A + 15 + 6 = A + 21. For this sum to be divisible by 9, A must be a number such that when added to 21, the result is a multiple of 9.\n\nThe smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 21 is 27. Therefore, A must be 27 - 21 = 6.\n\nNow we have both A and B as 6. The sum of A and B is 6 + 6 = 12.",

The two-digit multiples of 18 are: 18, 36, 54, 72, and 90.\n\nNext, we need to find which of these multiples has a remainder of 1 when divided by 7. We can do this by dividing each number by 7 and checking the remainder:\n\n- 18 \u00f7 7 = 2 remainder 4\n- 36 \u00f7 7 = 5 remainder 1\n- 54 \u00f7 7 = 7 remainder 5\n- 72 \u00f7 7 = 10 remainder 2\n- 90 \u00f7 7 = 12 remainder 6\n\nFrom the above calculations, we can see that 36 is the two-digit number that is a multiple of 6 and 9 and has a remainder of 1 when divided by 7.",
