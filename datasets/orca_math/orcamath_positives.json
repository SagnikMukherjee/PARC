Let's denote the diameter as D and the radius as R. We know that the radius is half the diameter, so R = D/2. The sum of the diameter and radius is given as D + R = 9 cm. Substituting R = D/2 into the equation, we get D + D/2 = 9 cm. Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fraction, we get 2D + D = 18 cm, which simplifies to 3D = 18 cm. Dividing both sides by 3, we find D = 6 cm. Therefore, the radius R of circle C is half of that, which is 3 cm.\n\nNow we can compare the radii:\n\n- Circle A radius = 5 cm\n- Circle B radius = 4 cm\n- Circle C radius = 3 cm\n\nCircle C, with a radius of 3 cm, is the smallest among the three circles.",

    "ground_truth_solution": "To find the largest number less than or equal to 100 that becomes a common multiple of 7 and 8 when 2 is subtracted, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 8 and then work backwards.\n\nThe LCM of 7 and 8 is 56 because 7 and 8 are both factors of 56 (7 * 8 = 56), and 56 is the smallest number that both 7 and 8 will divide into without a remainder.\n\nNow, we are looking for a number that becomes a multiple of 56 when 2 is subtracted from it. In other words, if x is the number we are looking for, then x - 2 should be a multiple of 56.\n\nLet's find the largest multiple of 56 that is less than or equal to 100 when 2 is added to it:\n\n100 + 2 = 102\n\nNow, we divide 102 by 56 to find the largest multiple of 56 that is less than or equal to 102:\n\n102 \u00f7 56 = 1 with a remainder of 46\n\nThis means that the largest multiple of 56 that is less than 102 is 1 * 56 = 56. However, we need to find the largest multiple of 56 that is less than or equal to 100 when 2 is added to it. Since 56 + 2 = 58, which is less than 100, we need to find the next multiple of 56 that is less than or equal to 100.\n\nThe next multiple of 56 is 56 * 2 = 112, but 112 + 2 = 114, which is greater than 100. Therefore, we cannot use this multiple.\n\nSo, the largest number less than or equal to 100 that becomes a common multiple of 7 and 8 when 2 is subtracted is 56 + 2 = 58.",

This is because if we subtract 2 from these numbers, they should become multiples of 56.\n\nLet's list the multiples of 56 less than or equal to 100: 56, 112. However, 112 is greater than 100, so we only consider 56.\n\nThe numbers that are 2 more than a multiple of 56 and less than or equal to 100 are: 58 (56 + 2).",

We can do this by adding 56 to the previous result and checking if it is less than or equal to 100.\n\n58 + 56 = 114, which is greater than 100. So, there are no other numbers less than or equal to 100 that are 2 more than a multiple of 56.",

Since they are skating in opposite directions, we add their speeds together:\nYeonjeong's speed = 100 m/min\nDonghun's speed = 150 m/min\nCombined speed = Yeonjeong's speed + Donghun's speed\nCombined speed = 100 m/min + 150 m/min\nCombined speed = 250 m/min\n\nNow we can find the time it takes for them to meet by dividing the circumference of the rink by their combined speed:\nTime = Circumference / Combined speed\nTime = 3,000 meters / 250 m/min\nTime = 12 minutes\n\nYeonjeong and Donghun will meet again for the first time after 12 minutes.",
