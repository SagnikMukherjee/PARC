    "question": "You have a right triangle with three sides, each measuring 10 centimeters (cm), 8 centimeters (cm), and 6 centimeters (cm). What is the length of the radius of the circumscribed circle?",
    "ground_truth_solution": "The circumscribed circle around a right triangle is also known as the circumcircle. The radius of this circle is called the circumradius. For a right triangle, the circumradius (R) can be found using the formula:\n\nR = hypotenuse / 2\n\nIn a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side, which is opposite the right angle. In this case, we have three sides: 10 cm, 8 cm, and 6 cm. To determine which side is the hypotenuse, we need to check if the triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the other two sides.\n\nLet's check if 10 cm is the hypotenuse:\n\n8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100\n10^2 = 100\n\nSince 100 = 100, the side measuring 10 cm is indeed the hypotenuse.\n\nNow we can use the formula to find the circumradius:\n\nR = hypotenuse / 2\nR = 10 cm / 2\nR = 5 cm\n\nThe length of the radius of the circumscribed circle around this right triangle is 5 centimeters.",

    "ground_truth_solution": "To calculate the surface area of the new shape, we need to consider the original surface area of the cube and then subtract the areas of the faces that were removed and add the areas of the new faces that were created by digging out the smaller cubes.\n\nThe original cube has 6 faces, each with an area of \\(10 \\text{ cm} \\times 10 \\text{ cm} = 100 \\text{ cm}^2\\). So the total surface area of the original cube is \\(6 \\times 100 \\text{ cm}^2 = 600 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nEach face of the original cube has a smaller cube dug out from its center. The smaller cube has an edge length of 2 cm, so each face of the smaller cube has an area of \\(2 \\text{ cm} \\times 2 \\text{ cm} = 4 \\text{ cm}^2\\). Since each smaller cube has 6 faces, the total area removed from each face of the original cube is \\(6 \\times 4 \\text{ cm}^2 = 24 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nHowever, we must consider that each small cube is dug out from the center of each face of the larger cube, so only one face of each small cube is actually removed from the larger cube's surface area. Therefore, for each face of the original cube, we subtract the area of one face of the smaller cube, which is \\(4 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nSince there are 6 faces on the original cube, the total area removed is \\(6 \\times 4 \\text{ cm}^2 = 24 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nNow, we need to add the area of the sides of the dug-out cubes that are now part of the surface. Each small cube has 5 faces contributing to the new surface area (since one face is the hole itself). Each of these faces has an area of \\(4 \\text{ cm}^2\\), so the total area added for each small cube is \\(5 \\times 4 \\text{ cm}^2 = 20 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nSince there is one small cube dug out from each face of the original cube, and there are 6 faces, the total area added is \\(6 \\times 20 \\text{ cm}^2 = 120 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nFinally, we calculate the total surface area of the new shape by subtracting the area removed and adding the area added to the original surface area:\n\nOriginal surface area: \\(600 \\text{ cm}^2\\)\nArea removed: \\(-24 \\text{ cm}^2\\)\nArea added: \\(+120 \\text{ cm}^2\\)\n\nTotal surface area of the new shape: \\(600 \\text{ cm}^2 - 24 \\text{ cm}^2 + 120 \\text{ cm}^2 = 696 \\text{ cm}^2\\)\n\nSo the surface area of the new shape is \\(696 \\text{ cm}^2\\).",

So the total number of pizza slices was:\n84 pieces (taken by students) + 5 pieces (left over) = 89 pieces\n\nNow, Seoyoon's classmate joins, making the total number of people to share the pizza 8. We need to divide the 89 pieces among 8 people.\n\n89 pieces / 8 people = 11 pieces/person with 1 piece remaining\n\nSo, after redistributing the pizza slices to 8 people, there will be 1 piece remaining.",

To find the number of diagonals that can be drawn from one vertex, we need to consider that a diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices. \n\nFrom any given vertex in a polygon, you can draw a diagonal to any other vertex except for itself and the two adjacent vertices (since connecting to those would form sides of the polygon, not diagonals). \n\nSo, for a 25-sided polygon (icosikaipentagon), from one vertex, you can draw a diagonal to 25 - 3 = 22 other vertices.\n\nTherefore, the number of diagonals that can be drawn from one vertex of an icosikaipentagon is 22.",

    "question": "I drew the largest rhombus in a circle with a radius of 10 centimeters (cm), and then drew a smaller rhombus by connecting the middle of all four sides of the rhombus. What is the area of the small rhombus in square centimeters (cm2)?",
    "ground_truth_solution": "To find the area of the smaller rhombus, we first need to determine the side length of the larger rhombus.\n\nSince the larger rhombus is the largest that can fit inside the circle, its vertices will touch the circumference of the circle. This means that the diagonals of the rhombus are equal to the diameter of the circle. The diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so in this case, it is 2 * 10 cm = 20 cm.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if the larger rhombus has diagonals of 20 cm each, they will intersect at the center of the rhombus and form four right-angled triangles, each with legs that are half the length of the diagonals (10 cm each).\n\nThe area of the larger rhombus can be found using the formula for the area of a rhombus, which is (d1 * d2) / 2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. So, the area of the larger rhombus is (20 cm * 20 cm) / 2 = 200 cm\u00b2.\n\nNow, let's find the side length of the smaller rhombus. The smaller rhombus is formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the larger rhombus. This means that each side of the smaller rhombus is half the length of the diagonal of the larger rhombus, which is 10 cm.\n\nThe smaller rhombus is also a rhombus, so its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other and bisect the angles of the rhombus. Since the diagonals of the larger rhombus are equal, the smaller rhombus will be a square, with each side equal to 10 cm.\n\nThe area of the smaller rhombus (which is a square) can be found using the formula for the area of a square, which is side^2. So, the area of the smaller rhombus is 10 cm * 10 cm = 100 cm\u00b2.",

The diagonal of the rhombus is also the diameter of the circle, which is 20 cm.\n\nStep 2: Find the side length of the large rhombus.\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the side length of the large rhombus.

Since there were 374 more pears than apples, we can express the number of pears as:\n\nNumber of pears = Number of apples + 374\nNumber of pears = 1238 + 374\nNumber of pears = 1612\n\nNow, we know that 276 pears were bought, so the new total number of pears is:\n\nNew total of pears = Original number of pears + Pears bought\nNew total of pears = 1612 + 276\nNew total of pears = 1888\n\nWe are given that the total number of apples and pears after the transactions is 2527. Let's denote the number of apples sold as A. The equation representing the total number of apples and pears after the transactions is:\n\nNumber of apples after selling some - A + New total of pears = Total number of apples and pears\n1238 - A + 1888 = 2527\n\nNow, let's solve for A:\n\n1238 - A + 1888 = 2527\n3126 - A = 2527\nA = 3126 - 2527\nA = 599\n\nSo, 599 apples have been sold.",

    "ground_truth_solution": "Let's start by figuring out the age difference between the older brother and the younger brother. When the older brother is 10, the younger brother is 7, which means there is a 3-year age difference between them.\n\nNow, let's find out the age of the younger brother when the older brother is 12. Since there is a 3-year age difference, the younger brother will be 12 - 3 = 9 years old when the older brother is 12.\n\nNext, we need to find out the age of the mother when the younger brother is 9. We know that when the younger brother is 5, the mother is 32 years old. So, to find the mother's age when the younger brother is 9, we need to add the difference in years to the mother's age when the younger brother was 5.\n\nThe difference in years between the younger brother being 5 and being 9 is 9 - 5 = 4 years.\n\nSo, the mother's age when the younger brother is 9 will be 32 (her age when the younger brother was 5) + 4 (the number of years that have passed) = 32 + 4 = 36 years old.\n\nFinally, we can find the sum of the ages of the younger brother and the mother when the older brother is 12 (and the younger brother is 9):\n\nYounger brother's age = 9 years old\nMother's age = 36 years old\n\nSum of their ages = 9 + 36 = 45 years old\n\nSo, the sum of the ages of the younger brother and the mother when the older brother is 12 years old is 45 years.",

    "solution": " To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of the younger brother and the mother when the older brother is 12 years old. \n\nStep 1: Let's denote the age of the older brother as 'x'. Since the younger brother is 7 years younger than the older brother, the age of the younger brother can be denoted as 'x - 7'.\n\nStep 2: We are given that when the younger brother is 5 years old, the mother is 32 years old. Since the younger brother is 5 years old, the older brother is 5 + 7 = 12 years old. However, we are given that the older brother is 10 years old when the younger brother is 7 years old. This means that the older brother's age 'x' is 10.\n\nStep 3: Now that we know the older brother's age 'x' is 10, we can find the age of the younger brother by subtracting 7 from 'x'. So, the age of the younger brother is 10 - 7 = 3.\n\nStep 4: We are given that when the younger brother is 5 years old, the mother is 32 years old. Since the younger brother is 3 years old now, the mother's age is 32 - (5 - 3) = 30.\n\nStep 5: Now that we know the age of the younger brother is 3 and the mother's age is 30, we need to find their ages when the older brother is 12 years old. Since the older brother's age is increasing by 2 years (from 10 to 12), the younger brother's age will also increase by 2 years (from 3 to 5) and the mother's age will remain the same (30).\n\nStep 6: Therefore, when the older brother is 12 years old, the younger brother will be 5 years old and the mother will be 30 years old.\n\nStep 7: To find the sum of their ages, we add the age of the younger brother (5) and the age of the mother (30). The sum of their ages is 5 + 30 = 35.\n\nThe final answer is: 35",

This is a combination problem since the order in which we select the subjects does not matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nWhere:\n- n is the total number of items to choose from,\n- k is the number of items to choose,\n- \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nFor selecting 2 subjects from 6 people, we have:\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!)\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * 4!)\nC(6, 2) = (6 * 5 * 4!) / (2 * 1 * 4!)\nC(6, 2) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1)\nC(6, 2) = 30 / 2\nC(6, 2) = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 ways to select 2 subjects from 6 people.\n\nNext, we need to select 1 king from the remaining 4 people (since 2 have already been chosen as subjects). This is a simple selection problem, and there are 4 ways to choose 1 king from 4 people.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to select 2 subjects and 1 king, we multiply the number of ways to select the subjects by the number of ways to select the king:\n\nTotal ways = Ways to select subjects * Ways to select king\nTotal ways = 15 * 4\nTotal ways = 60\n\nTherefore, there are 60 different ways to select 2 subjects and 1 king from 6 people.",

    "question": "How many three-digit integers can be created by pressing 3 of the 6 buttons on a calculator with the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 on them?",
    "ground_truth_solution": "To create a three-digit integer, we need to select 3 different numbers from the 6 available (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and arrange them in a sequence where the first digit cannot be 0 (since that would make it a two-digit number).\n\nFirst, we select 3 different numbers from the 6 available. This can be done in \\( \\binom{6}{3} \\) ways, which is the number of combinations of 6 things taken 3 at a time. The formula for combinations is \\( \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\), where \\( n! \\) denotes the factorial of n.\n\nSo, \\( \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20 \\) ways.\n\nNow, for each of these combinations, we need to arrange them into a three-digit number. However, we must remember that the first digit cannot be 0. So, for each combination, we have two cases:\n\n1. If the combination includes the number 0, we have 2 choices for the first digit (any of the other two numbers), and then 2 choices for the second digit (the remaining number or 0), and finally 1 choice for the last digit (whichever number is left). This gives us \\( 2 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4 \\) arrangements for each combination that includes 0.\n\n2. If the combination does not include the number 0, we have 3 choices for the first digit, 2 choices for the second digit, and 1 choice for the last digit. This gives us \\( 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\) arrangements for each combination that does not include 0.\n\nTo find out how many of the 20 combinations include the number 0, we can calculate it as follows: We have 1 choice for the number 0, and then we need to choose 2 more numbers from the remaining 5 numbers. This can be done in \\( \\binom{5}{2} \\) ways.\n\n\\( \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10 \\) ways.\n\nSo, there are 10 combinations that include the number 0, and each of these can be arranged in 4 ways, giving us \\( 10 \\times 4 = 40 \\) three-digit numbers.\n\nThe remaining \\( 20 - 10 = 10 \\) combinations do not include the number 0, and each of these can be arranged in 6 ways, giving us \\( 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\) three-digit numbers.\n\nAdding these together, we get \\( 40 + 60 = 100 \\) three-digit integers that can be created by pressing 3 of the 6 buttons on the calculator.",

    "solution": " To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways to choose 3 digits out of 6 and then arrange them to form a 3-digit number.\n\nStep 1: Choosing the digits\nWe have 6 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) and we need to choose 3 of them. This is a combination problem, where the order of selection does not matter. The number of ways to choose 3 digits out of 6 is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (6 in this case), k is the number of items to choose (3 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1).\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\n= 6! / (3!3!)\n= (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / ((3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)(3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1))\n= (720) / (36)\n= 20\n\nSo, there are 20 ways to choose 3 digits out of 6.\n\nStep 2: Arranging the digits\nOnce we have chosen 3 digits, we need to arrange them to form a 3-digit number. This is a permutation problem, where the order of selection matters. Since we have 3 digits, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange them.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the case where the first digit is 0. If the first digit is 0, the number is not a three-digit number, so we need to exclude these cases. There are 19 ways to choose 2 digits out of the remaining 5 (excluding 0), and 2! = 2 ways to arrange them. So, there are 19 \u00d7 2 = 38 invalid cases.\n\nStep 3: Total number of valid three-digit numbers\nWe have 20 ways to choose 3 digits and 6 ways to arrange them, but we need to exclude the 38 invalid cases where the first digit is 0. Therefore, the total number of valid three-digit numbers is:\n\n20 \u00d7 6 - 38\n= 120 - 38\n= 82\n\nHowever, we need to consider the case where the three-digit number starts with 0. In this case, we have 5 choices for the second digit and 4 choices for the third digit. So, there are 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 valid three-digit numbers that start with 0.\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid three-digit numbers is:\n\n82 + 20\n= 102\n\nHowever, we need to consider the case where the three-digit number starts with 0 and the second digit is also 0. In this case, we have 4 choices for the third digit. So, there are 4 valid three-digit numbers that start with 00.\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid three-digit numbers is:\n\n102 + 4\n= 106",

    "ground_truth_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of the 2-meter sections of both the doll and the tree and then add those weights together.\n\nFirst, let's find the weight per meter for both the doll and the tree:\n\nThe doll is 5 meters long and weighs 29/8 kilograms. To find the weight per meter, we divide the total weight by the total length:\nWeight per meter (doll) = Total weight (doll) / Total length (doll)\nWeight per meter (doll) = (29/8) kg / 5 m\nWeight per meter (doll) = (29/8) * (1/5) kg/m\nWeight per meter (doll) = 29/40 kg/m\n\nThe tree is 4 meters long and weighs 2.8 kilograms. To find the weight per meter, we divide the total weight by the total length:\nWeight per meter (tree) = Total weight (tree) / Total length (tree)\nWeight per meter (tree) = 2.8 kg / 4 m\nWeight per meter (tree) = 0.7 kg/m\n\nNow, let's find the weight of a 2-meter section of both the doll and the tree:\n\nWeight of 2-meter section (doll) = Weight per meter (doll) * 2 m\nWeight of 2-meter section (doll) = (29/40) kg/m * 2 m\nWeight of 2-meter section (doll) = 29/20 kg\n\nWeight of 2-meter section (tree) = Weight per meter (tree) * 2 m\nWeight of 2-meter section (tree) = 0.7 kg/m * 2 m\nWeight of 2-meter section (tree) = 1.4 kg\n\nFinally, let's add the weights of the 2-meter sections together:\n\nTotal weight of 2-meter sections = Weight of 2-meter section (doll) + Weight of 2-meter section (tree)\nTotal weight of 2-meter sections = (29/20) kg + 1.4 kg\n\nTo add these together, we need to convert 1.4 kg to a fraction with the same denominator as 29/20, which is 20:\n\n1.4 kg = 1.4 * (20/20) kg\n1.4 kg = (1.4 * 20) / 20 kg\n1.4 kg = 28/20 kg\n\nNow we can add the two fractions:\n\nTotal weight of 2-meter sections = (29/20) kg + (28/20) kg\nTotal weight of 2-meter sections = (29 + 28) / 20 kg\nTotal weight of 2-meter sections = 57/20 kg\n\nTo convert this to a mixed number, we divide 57 by 20:\n\n57 \u00f7 20 = 2 with a remainder of 17\n\nSo, 57/20 kg is equal to 2 kg and 17/20 kg.\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the 2-meter sections of the doll and the tree together is 2 kg and 17/20 kg.",

To find out how many 2-meter pieces the doll can be cut into, we divide the length of the doll by 2:\n\n5 m / 2 m = 2.5\n\nSince the doll can be cut into 2.5 pieces, we will consider 2 pieces of 2 meters each and the remaining 1 meter. The weight of the doll is 29/8 kg.

Assuming that \"corners\" is a mistaken term and should be \"edges\" (E), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nV + E + F = 50\n\nNow, let's use Euler's formula to find the relationship between V, E, and F for the prism:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for E:\n\nE = V + F - 2\n\nSince we know that V + E + F = 50, we can substitute E in the above equation:\n\nE = (50 - E) - 2\n\nNow, let's solve for E:\n\nE = 50 - E - 2\n2E = 48\nE = 24\n\nSo, the prism has 24 edges.\n\nNow, let's find the number of edges of the pyramid that has the same base shape as the prism. A pyramid has one less edge on the base than the prism because the base of the pyramid is the same as one of the faces of the prism, and the rest of the edges of the pyramid come from the vertices of the base to the apex.\n\nLet's denote the number of edges on the base of the prism as B. Since a prism has two congruent bases, the total number of edges on the bases of the prism is 2B. The remaining edges of the prism are the ones that connect the corresponding vertices of the two bases, which is equal to the number of vertices on one base (also B).\n\nSo, for the prism, we have:\n\nE (total edges of prism) = 2B (edges on bases) + B (vertical edges)\n24 = 2B + B\n24 = 3B\nB = 24 / 3\nB = 8\n\nThe base of the prism has 8 edges, which means the base is an octagon.\n\nNow, for the pyramid with an octagonal base, the number of edges will be the number of edges on the base (8) plus the number of edges from the vertices of the base to the apex (also 8, since there is one edge from each vertex of the base to the apex).\n\nTherefore, the pyramid has 8 (base edges) + 8 (edges to apex) = 16 edges.",

The number of faces of the prism is 2 (the two bases) + n (the rectangular faces). The number of edges of the prism is 3n (the edges of the two bases) + n (the edges connecting the bases).\n\nGiven that the sum of the number of vertices, faces, and edges is 50, we can write the equation:\n\n2n + (2n + n) + (3n + n) = 50\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n8n + 2n = 50\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n10n = 50\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\nn = 5\n\nNow that we know the number of vertices in each base is 5, we can find the number of edges of the prism. The number of edges of the prism is 3n + n = 4n. Since n = 5, the number of edges of the prism is 4 * 5 = 20.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of edges that have the same base shape as the prism. Since the prism has two identical bases, the edges that have the same base shape as the prism are the edges of the base. The number of edges of the base is equal to the number of vertices in the base, which is 5.\n\nTherefore, the number of edges of the pyramid that have the same base shape as the prism is 5.",

The number 72 is a composite number that can be factored into prime factors as 72 = 2^3 * 3^2. This means that for a number to be a multiple of 72, it must be a multiple of both 2^3 (which is 8) and 3^2 (which is 9).\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. A multiple of 8: For a number to be a multiple of 8, its last three digits must be divisible by 8. In the number A4461B, the last three digits are \"61B\". We need to find a value for B such that 61B is divisible by 8.\n\n2. A multiple of 9: For a number to be a multiple of 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. In the number A4461B, the sum of the digits is A + 4 + 4 + 6 + 1 + B. We need to find values for A and B such that this sum is divisible by 9.\n\nLet's start with the first condition:\n\nFor 61B to be divisible by 8, we can test the possible values for B (0 through 9) and see which one makes 61B divisible by 8. We can do this by checking the divisibility of the numbers 610, 611, 612, ..., 619 by 8.\n\nUpon checking, we find that 616 is divisible by 8 (since 616 / 8 = 77). Therefore, B must be 6.\n\nNow let's move on to the second condition:\n\nThe sum of the digits is A + 4 + 4 + 6 + 1 + B = A + 15 + B. Since B is 6, the sum becomes A + 15 + 6 = A + 21. For this sum to be divisible by 9, A must be a number such that when added to 21, the result is a multiple of 9.\n\nThe smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 21 is 27. Therefore, A must be 27 - 21 = 6.\n\nNow we have both A and B as 6. The sum of A and B is 6 + 6 = 12.",

    "ground_truth_solution": "Let's denote the number of 200-pencil cases as \\( x \\) and the number of 150-pencil cases as \\( y \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, we have two equations:\n\n1. The total number of pencil cases is the sum of the 200-pencil cases and the 150-pencil cases, minus the 12 cases left over:\n\\[ x + y = 12 \\]\n\n2. The total number of pens is the sum of the pens in the 200-pencil cases and the 150-pencil cases, plus the 30 pens left over:\n\\[ 200x + 150y + 30 = 2180 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) using these equations.\n\nFirst, let's solve the first equation for \\( y \\):\n\\[ y = 12 - x \\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\( y \\) in the second equation with \\( 12 - x \\):\n\\[ 200x + 150(12 - x) + 30 = 2180 \\]\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\\[ 200x + 1800 - 150x + 30 = 2180 \\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\\[ 50x + 1830 = 2180 \\]\n\nSubtract 1830 from both sides:\n\\[ 50x = 2180 - 1830 \\]\n\\[ 50x = 350 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 50 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{350}{50} \\]\n\\[ x = 7 \\]\n\nSo, there are 7 cases that can hold 200 pencils each.",
