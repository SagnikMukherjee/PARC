    "question": "There were 50 racers in a bicycle charity race at the beginning of the race. After 20 minutes, 30 more racers joined the race. The total number of racers doubled after another x minutes. If at the end of the race only 130 people finished the race, what's the total number of people who dropped before finishing the race?\nIf we know the answer to the above question is 30, what is the value of unknown variable x?",
    "ground_truth_solution": "At the beginning of the race, there were 50 racers.\nAfter 20 minutes, 30 more racers joined the race, making the total number of racers 50 + 30 = 80.\nThe total number of racers doubled after another x minutes, so after x minutes, there were 80 * 2 = 160 racers.\nAt the end of the race, only 130 people finished the race.\nThe difference between the total number of racers at the end of the race and the number of people who finished is the number of people who dropped before finishing the race: 160 - 130 = 30.\nWe are given that the number of people who dropped before finishing the race is 30, so the value of x is 30.\n#### 30\nThe answer is: 30",
    "ground_truth_answer": "30",

    "solution": " To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and use algebraic equations.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the initial number of racers as R1 = 50, the number of racers that joined after 20 minutes as R2 = 30, and the total number of racers at the end of the race as R3.\n\nStep 2: After 20 minutes, the total number of racers is the sum of the initial racers and the racers that joined, which is R1 + R2 = 50 + 30 = 80.\n\nStep 3: The total number of racers doubled after another x minutes, so R3 = 2 * (R1 + R2) = 2 * 80 = 160.\n\nStep 4: However, we know that only 130 people finished the race, which means that 160 - 130 = 30 people dropped before finishing the race.\n\nStep 5: Since we know that 30 people dropped before finishing the race, we can set up an equation to find the value of x. The total number of racers at the end of the race (R3) is equal to the initial number of racers (R1) plus the number of racers that joined (R2) plus the number of racers that dropped (D). We know that D = 30, so we can write the equation as R3 = R1 + R2 + D.\n\nStep 6: Substituting the values we know, we get 160 = 50 + 30 + 30.\n\nStep 7: However, we need to find the value of x. To do this, we need to find the time it took for the total number of racers to double. Since the total number of racers doubled after x minutes, we can set up a proportion to relate the initial number of racers to the final number of racers.\n\nStep 8: Let's denote the time it took for the total number of racers to double as x. We can set up a proportion: (R1 + R2) / R1 = (R3 / (R1 + R2)). We know that R1 = 50, R2 = 30, and R3 = 160.\n\nStep 9: Substituting the values we know, we get (80 / 50) = (160 / (50 + 30)).\n\nStep 10: Simplifying the equation, we get 1.6 = (160 / 80).\n\nStep 11: Since 1.6 = 160 / 100, we can rewrite the equation as (160 / 80) = (160 / 100).\n\nStep 12: Cross-multiplying, we get 160 * 100 = 80 * 160.\n\nStep 13: Simplifying the equation, we get 16000 = 12800.\n\nStep 14: However, we made a mistake in our previous steps. We need to find the value of x, which is the time it took for the total number of racers to double. To do this, we need to use the fact that the total number of racers doubled after x minutes.\n\nStep 15: Let's denote the initial number of racers as R1 = 80 (after 20 minutes), and the final number of racers as R3 = 160.\n\nStep 16: Since the total number of racers doubled after x minutes, we can set up a proportion: R1 / (R1 * 2) = 20 / x.\n\nStep 17: Substituting the values we know, we get 80 / 160 = 20 / x.\n\nStep 18: Simplifying the equation, we get 1/2 = 20 / x.\n\nStep 19: Cross-multiplying, we get x = 20 * 2.\n\nStep 20: Simplifying the equation, we get x = 40.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{40}$",

She paid half of the lottery amount for the taxes on her winnings, then put a third of the leftover money towards her student loans. She put $1000 in savings and invested a fifth of that amount in the stock market. How many dollars does she have left for fun?\nIf we know the answer to the above question is 2802, what is the value of unknown variable x?",
    "ground_truth_solution": "Marge had a winning lottery ticket for $x.\nShe paid half of the lottery amount for taxes, which means she paid (1/2)*x dollars for taxes.\nThe leftover money is: x - (1/2)*x = (1/2)*x.\nShe put a third of the leftover money towards her student loans, which means she put (1/3)*((1/2)*x) = (1/6)*x dollars towards her student loans.\nThe remaining money is: (1/2)*x - (1/6)*x = (1/3)*x.\nShe put $1000 in savings, so the remaining money is: (1/3)*x - $1000.\nShe invested a fifth of $1000 in the stock market, which means she invested (1/5)*$1000 = $200 in the stock market.\nThe money she has left for fun is: (1/3)*x - $1000 - $200 = (1/3)*x - $1200.\nWe are given that the money she has left for fun is $2802, so we can write: (1/3)*x - $1200 = $2802.\nAdding $1200 to both sides, we get: (1/3)*x = $4002.\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get: x = $12006.\nThe value of x is $12006.\n#### 12006\nThe answer is: 12006",

    "solution": " To solve this problem, we will work backwards from the final amount Marge has left for fun, which is $2802.\n\nStep 1: \nMarge invested a fifth of her savings in the stock market. Let's call the amount she put in savings 's'. Then, the amount she invested in the stock market is s/5. We know that the amount she has left after investing in the stock market is $2802. So, the amount she had before investing in the stock market is $2802 + (s/5).\n\nStep 2: \nMarge put $1000 in savings. So, the amount she had before putting money in savings is $2802 + (s/5) + $1000.\n\nStep 3: \nMarge put a third of the leftover money towards her student loans. Let's call the amount she had before putting money in savings and before paying taxes 'x'. Then, the amount she had after paying taxes is x/2. The amount she had before paying taxes is 3*(x/2) = (3/2)*x.\n\nStep 4: \nNow, we can equate the two expressions for the amount she had before putting money in savings and before paying taxes: (3/2)*x = $2802 + (s/5) + $1000.\n\nStep 5: \nWe know that s = $1000. So, we can substitute this value into the equation: (3/2)*x = $2802 + ($1000/5) + $1000.\n\nStep 6: \nSimplify the equation: (3/2)*x = $2802 + $200 + $1000.\n\nStep 7: \nCombine the constants on the right-hand side of the equation: (3/2)*x = $4002.\n\nStep 8: \nMultiply both sides of the equation by 2/3 to solve for x: x = $4002 * (2/3).\n\nStep 9: \nSimplify the equation: x = $2664.\n\nThe final answer is: $2664",

To find the number of terms, we need to subtract the starting power from the ending power and add 1 (since we are including both the starting and ending powers).\nNumber of terms = 2006 - 1 + 1 = 2006\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of pairs of -1 and 1 in the series\nSince the powers of -1 alternate between -1 and 1, we can pair each -1 with a 1. The number of pairs is equal to half the number of terms.\nNumber of pairs = 2006 / 2 = 1003\n\nStep 4: Calculate the sum of the series\nSince each pair consists of -1 and 1, their sum is 0. Therefore, the sum of all pairs is 0.\nHowever, we need to consider the last term, which is (-1)^2006. Since 2006 is even, (-1)^2006 = 1.\nSo, the sum of the series is equal to the sum of all pairs plus the last term.\nSum = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nTherefore, the sum of the series $(-1)^1+(-1)^2+\\cdots+(-1)^{2006}$ is 1.",

    "question": "Flies are Betty's frog's favorite food. Every day the frog eats 2 flies. Betty puts the flies she finds in a bottle. In the morning Betty catches 5 flies inside a bottle, and in the afternoon she catches 6 more, but when she removes the lid, one escapes.  Betty wants to gather the whole week's food for her frog. How many more flies does she need?",
    "ground_truth_solution": "Betty catches 5 flies in the morning and 6 flies in the afternoon, but one escapes when she removes the lid. So she has a total of 5 + 6 - 1 = 10 flies in the bottle.\nHer frog eats 2 flies every day, so in a week, it will eat 2 x 7 = 14 flies.\nBetty already has 10 flies, so she still needs 14 - 10 = 4 more flies.\nTherefore, Betty needs 4 more flies.\n#### 4\nThe answer is: 4",

    "solution": " To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flies the frog eats in a week and the total number of flies Betty has caught, then find the difference between the two.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of flies the frog eats in a week.\nThe frog eats 2 flies per day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of flies the frog eats in a week is:\n2 flies/day * 7 days = 14 flies\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of flies Betty catches in a day.\nIn the morning, Betty catches 5 flies, and in the afternoon, she catches 6 more. However, one fly escapes when she removes the lid. So, the total number of flies she catches in a day is:\n5 flies (morning) + 6 flies (afternoon) - 1 fly (escaped) = 10 flies\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of flies Betty catches in a week.\nSince Betty catches 10 flies per day, the total number of flies she catches in a week is:\n10 flies/day * 7 days = 70 flies\n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of flies Betty needs to gather for the whole week.\nTo find the number of flies Betty needs, we subtract the total number of flies the frog eats in a week from the total number of flies she catches in a week:\n70 flies (caught) - 14 flies (eaten) = 56 flies\n\nTherefore, Betty needs 56 more flies to gather the whole week's food for her frog.",

Danny ordered 2 quarter-pounder burgers for $3.20 each, x large fries that cost $1.90 each, and 2 milkshakes that cost $2.40 each. He should order 3 more worth of food to avail of the free delivery. What is the value of unknown variable x? What is the value of unknown variable x?",
    "ground_truth_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the number of large fries that Danny ordered.\nLet's break down the information given:\nCost of each quarter-pounder burger: $3.20\nNumber of quarter-pounder burgers: 2\nCost of each large fries: $1.90\nNumber of large fries: x\nCost of each milkshake: $2.40\nNumber of milkshakes: 2\nTotal amount needed to avail free delivery: $18\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\nCost of quarter-pounder burgers + Cost of large fries + Cost of milkshakes + Additional food cost = Total amount needed for free delivery\n($3.20 * 2) + ($1.90 * x) + ($2.40 * 2) + 3 = $18\nLet's simplify and solve for x:\n$6.40 + $1.90x + $4.80 + 3 = $18\n$10.20 + $1.90x + 3 = $18\n$13.20 + $1.90x = $18\nTo isolate x, we subtract $13.20 from both sides of the equation:\n$13.20 - $13.20 + $1.90x = $18 - $13.20\n$1.90x = $4.80\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by $1.90:\nx = $4.80 / $1.90\nx = 2\nThe value of x is 2.\n#### 2\nThe answer is: 2",
    "ground_truth_answer": "2",
    "model_answer": "0.21",
    "solution": " To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the food that Danny ordered and then determine the additional amount he needs to order to reach the minimum purchase of $18 for free delivery.\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the 2 quarter-pounder burgers:\n   Cost of 2 quarter-pounder burgers = 2 * $3.20 = $6.40\n\n2. Calculate the cost of the 2 milkshakes:\n   Cost of 2 milkshakes = 2 * $2.40 = $4.80\n\n3. The total cost of the food ordered so far is the sum of the cost of the burgers and the milkshakes:\n   Total cost so far = $6.40 + $4.80 = $11.20\n\n4. The cost of x large fries is given as $1.90 each. Since Danny ordered 3 more worth of food, the cost of the additional fries is:\n   Cost of additional fries = $1.90x\n\n5. The total cost of the additional food is the sum of the cost of the additional fries and the cost of the 2 more quarter-pounder burgers (since he needs to order 3 more worth of food):\n   Total cost of additional food = $1.90x + 2 * $3.20 = $1.90x + $6.40\n\n6. The total cost of the food ordered should be equal to or greater than $18 for free delivery. Therefore, the total cost of the food ordered (including the additional food) should be:\n   Total cost = $11.20 + $1.90x + $6.40 \u2265 $18\n\n7. Simplify the inequality:\n   $1.90x + $17.60 \u2265 $18\n\n8. Subtract $17.60 from both sides of the inequality:\n   $1.90x \u2265 $0.40\n\n9. Divide both sides of the inequality by $1.90:\n   x \u2265 $0.21\n\nSince x represents the number of large fries, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the smallest possible value of x is 1.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the value of x, but it is not clear if it is asking for the minimum value of x or the value of x that makes the total cost exactly $18. If we assume that the question is asking for the value of x that makes the total cost exactly $18, we can set up the equation:\n\n$11.20 + $1.90x + $6.40 = $18\n\nCombine like terms:\n$17.60 + $1.90x = $18\n\nSubtract $17.60 from both sides:\n$1.90x = $0.40\n\nDivide both sides by $1.90:\nx = $0.21\n\nSince x represents the number of large fries, it must be a whole number. However, the result is a decimal value. This means that the total cost of the additional food ($1.90x + $6.40) is not enough to reach the minimum purchase of $18. Therefore, the question's assumption that Danny should order 3 more worth of food to avail of the free delivery is incorrect.\n\nTo find the correct value of x, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's assume that Danny needs to order a total of $18 worth of food to avail of the free delivery. The total cost of the food ordered so far is $11.20. Therefore, the cost of the additional food should be:\n$18 - $11.20 = $6.80\n\nThe cost of the additional fries is $1.90x. The cost of the 2 more quarter-pounder burgers is $6.40. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n$1.90x + $6.40 = $6.80\n\nSubtract $6.40 from both sides:\n$1.90x = $0.40\n\nDivide both sides by $1.90:\nx = $0.21\n\nHowever, this result is still a decimal value. This means that the total cost of the additional food ($1.90x + $6.40) is not enough to reach the minimum purchase of $18.

    "solution": " To find the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games, we need to consider the number of ways they can win 4, 5, 6, or 7 games out of the 7 games.\n\nSince each team has an equal chance of winning each game, the probability of the Badgers winning a single game is 1/2, and the probability of losing a single game is also 1/2.\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula to find the probability of the Badgers winning exactly k games out of n games:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) \\* (p^k) \\* (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of games (7)\n- k is the number of games won (4, 5, 6, or 7)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of winning a game (1/2)\n- q is the probability of losing a game (1/2)\n\nWe need to calculate the probability for each of the four cases (winning 4, 5, 6, or 7 games) and then add them together.\n\n**Case 1: Winning 4 games**\n\nP(X = 4) = (7C4) \\* (1/2)^4 \\* (1/2)^(7-4)\n= (35) \\* (1/16) \\* (1/4)\n= 35/64\n\n**Case 2: Winning 5 games**\n\nP(X = 5) = (7C5) \\* (1/2)^5 \\* (1/2)^(7-5)\n= (21) \\* (1/32) \\* (1/2)\n= 21/64\n\n**Case 3: Winning 6 games**\n\nP(X = 6) = (7C6) \\* (1/2)^6 \\* (1/2)^(7-6)\n= (7) \\* (1/64) \\* (1/2)\n= 7/128\n\n**Case 4: Winning 7 games**\n\nP(X = 7) = (7C7) \\* (1/2)^7 \\* (1/2)^(7-7)\n= (1) \\* (1/128) \\* (1)\n= 1/128\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of all four cases together:\n\nP(at least 4 wins) = P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + P(X = 7)\n= 35/64 + 21/64 + 7/128 + 1/128\n= (35 + 21 + 7 + 1)/64\n= 64/64\n= 1\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.

    "ground_truth_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the rate at which Toby's hose runs in gallons per hour.\nLet's break down the information given:\nTime to fill the pool: 50 hours\nCost to fill the pool: $5\nCost per 10 gallons of water: 1 cent\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\nRate of the hose * Time to fill the pool = Total amount of water needed\nx * 50 = Total amount of water needed\nTo find the total amount of water needed, we need to convert the cost to fill the pool from dollars to cents and then divide it by the cost per 10 gallons of water:\n$5 * 100 cents/dollar / 1 cent/10 gallons = 500 cents / 1 cent/10 gallons = 5000 gallons\nx * 50 = 5000\nLet's solve for x:\n50x = 5000\nTo isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 50:\n50x / 50 = 5000 / 50\nx = 100\nThe value of x is 100.\n#### 100\nThe answer is: 100",

    "solution": " To solve for the unknown variable x, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  First, let's find out how many gallons of water it takes to fill the pool. Since it costs 5 dollars to fill the pool and water costs 1 cent for 10 gallons, we can calculate the total gallons of water needed to fill the pool.\n\n   The cost of water to fill the pool is 5 dollars, and the cost per 10 gallons is 1 cent. To find the total gallons, we need to convert the cost to cents first. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, 5 dollars is equal to 500 cents.\n\n   Now, we can find the total gallons by dividing the total cost in cents by the cost per 10 gallons.\n\n   Total gallons = (Total cost in cents) / (Cost per 10 gallons)\n   Total gallons = 500 cents / 1 cent per 10 gallons\n   Total gallons = 500 / 1\n   Total gallons = 50 * 10 (since 500 / 1 = 500, and 500 is 50 * 10)\n   Total gallons = 500 gallons\n\n2.  Now that we know the pool takes 500 gallons to fill, we can use the time it takes to fill the pool (50 hours) and the unknown variable x (gallons per hour) to find the value of x.\n\n   We know that time = distance / speed. In this case, the distance is the total gallons of water needed to fill the pool (500 gallons), and the speed is the rate at which the hose fills the pool (x gallons per hour).\n\n   We can rearrange the formula to solve for speed (x). \n\n   Speed (x) = Distance / Time\n   x = 500 gallons / 50 hours\n   x = 10 gallons per hour\n\nTherefore, the value of the unknown variable x is 10 gallons per hour.",

    "ground_truth_solution": "Anna sold 36 glasses of plain lemonade for $x each, so the total amount she made from selling plain lemonade is 36x dollars.\nShe made $16 total from selling strawberry lemonade.\nTo find out how much more she made from plain lemonade than strawberry, we can subtract the amount she made from strawberry lemonade from the amount she made from plain lemonade: 36x - 16.\nWe are given that the difference is 11 dollars, so we can write: 36x - 16 = 11.\nAdding 16 to both sides, we get: 36x = 27.\nDividing both sides by 36, we get: x = 0.75.\nThe value of x is 0.75.\n#### 0.75\nThe answer is: 0.75",

    "solution": " To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem\nWe know that Anna sold 36 glasses of plain lemonade for $x each. We also know that she made $16 from selling strawberry lemonade. We need to find out how much more she made from plain lemonade than strawberry lemonade.\n\nStep 2: Set up the equation\nLet's assume the amount she made from plain lemonade is P and the amount she made from strawberry lemonade is S. We know that P = 36x (since she sold 36 glasses of plain lemonade for $x each) and S = $16.\n\nStep 3: Find the difference between the amount made from plain lemonade and strawberry lemonade\nWe are given that the difference between the amount made from plain lemonade and strawberry lemonade is $11. So, we can set up the equation: P - S = 11.\n\nStep 4: Substitute the values of P and S into the equation\nSubstituting P = 36x and S = $16 into the equation, we get: 36x - 16 = 11.\n\nStep 5: Solve for x\nTo solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 16 to both sides of the equation: 36x = 11 + 16. This simplifies to 36x = 27.\n\nStep 6: Divide both sides by 36\nTo find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 36: x = 27 / 36.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the fraction\nx = 27 / 36 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9. This gives us x = 3 / 4.\n\nHowever, since the answer is expected to be a dollar amount, we can multiply the fraction by 4 to get the dollar amount: x = (3 / 4) * 4 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the value of the unknown variable x is $3.",

    "solution": " To find the area of Blossom's room in square inches, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  First, we need to find the area of the room in square feet. Since the room is 10 feet long in each direction, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side \u00d7 side.\n\n2.  The formula for the area of a square is A = s \u00d7 s, where A is the area and s is the length of a side. In this case, the length of a side is 10 feet.\n\n3.  So, we can plug in the value of the side into the formula: A = 10 \u00d7 10.\n\n4.  Multiplying 10 by 10 gives us 100 square feet.\n\n5.  Now that we have the area of the room in square feet, we need to convert it to square inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can multiply the area in square feet by 12 to get the area in square inches.\n\n6.  So, we multiply 100 square feet by 12 inches/foot: 100 \u00d7 12 = 1200.\n\n7.  Therefore, the area of Blossom's room in square inches is 1200 square inches.\n\nThe final answer is 1200.",

    "solution": " To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and use algebra to represent the unknowns.\n\nLet's denote the time it took Ethan to learn 12 fencing tricks as 'x' days.\n\nSince Alexa spent 3/4ths of the time it took Ethan to learn 12 fencing tricks, we can write an equation for Alexa's time:\n\nAlexa's time = (3/4)x\n\nWe are given that Alexa spent a week and 2 days on vacation. To convert this to days, we multiply the number of weeks by 7 and add the number of days:\n\nAlexa's time = 7 weeks * 7 days/week + 2 days = 49 + 2 = 51 days\n\nNow we can equate this to (3/4)x:\n\n(3/4)x = 51\n\nTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4/3:\n\nx = 51 * (4/3)\nx = 68\n\nSo, it took Ethan 68 days to learn 12 fencing tricks.\n\nNow, we are given that Joey spent half as much time as Ethan learning to swim. Since Ethan took 68 days to learn fencing tricks, Joey took half of that time to learn swimming:\n\nJoey's time = (1/2) * 68\nJoey's time = 34 days\n\nTherefore, it took Joey 34 days to learn swimming.",

Reggie starts with 0 marbles and wins 'w' games, so he gets 10w marbles from his friend. He loses 'l' games, so he gives away 10l marbles to his friend. After 9 games, he has 90 marbles, so we can set up the equation:\n\n10w - 10l = 90\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 10:\n\nw - l = 9\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\nw + l = 9\nw - l = 9\n\nWe can add these two equations to eliminate 'l':\n\n2w = 18\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nw = 9\n\nNow that we know Reggie won 9 games, we can find the number of games he lost by substituting 'w' into one of the original equations:\n\nl = 9 - w\nl = 9 - 9\nl = 0\n\nSo, Reggie lost 0 games.",

    "ground_truth_solution": "We know that ten years later, Jessica's mother would have been 70 years old.\nIf her mother were alive now, she would be 70 - 10 = 60 years old.\nWe are given that Jessica was x% her mother's age when her mother died, which means Jessica's age at that time was (x/100) * 60 years.\nWe are also given that Jessica's current age is 40 years.\nSo we can write: (x/100) * 60 + 10 = 40.\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get: (x/100) * 60 = 30.\nDividing both sides by 60, we get: x/100 = 0.5.\nMultiplying both sides by 100, we get: x = 50.\nThe value of x is 50.\n#### 50\nThe answer is: 50",
    "ground_truth_answer": "50",
    "model_answer": "67",
    "solution": " To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote Jessica's current age as J and her mother's current age as M. We know that Jessica was x% of her mother's age when her mother died. Since her mother is now 70 if she were alive, we can calculate her current age as 70 - 10 = 60.\n\nStep 2: Since Jessica was x% of her mother's age when her mother died, we can set up the equation: J = (x/100) * M. However, we don't know the value of M yet.\n\nStep 3: We know that Jessica's current age is 40. We also know that her mother's current age is 60. We can use this information to find the value of x.\n\nStep 4: Since Jessica's current age is 40 and her mother's current age is 60, we can set up the equation: 40 = (x/100) * 60.\n\nStep 5: To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to get rid of the fraction: 4000 = 60x.\n\nStep 6: Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 60 to solve for x: x = 4000 / 60.\n\nStep 7: Simplifying the equation, we get x = 66.67.\n\nHowever, the problem statement asks for the value of x as a percentage, so we need to convert the decimal to a percentage by multiplying by 100: x = 66.67 * 100 = 66.67%.\n\nHowever, the answer is expected to be a whole number. Since the answer is given as 40, we can assume that the problem is asking for the percentage value of x as a whole number. In that case, we can round the value of x to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe final answer is: 67",

    "solution": " To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of gold coins Roman had and then subtract the number of coins he sold to Dorothy.\n\nLet's denote the initial number of gold coins as 'x'. Since each gold coin is worth $20, the total value of the gold coins Roman initially had is $20x.\n\nWe know that Roman sold 3 gold coins to Dorothy and received a payment of $12. This means that the total value of the 3 gold coins he sold is $12.\n\nSince each gold coin is worth $20, the value of 3 gold coins is 3 * $20 = $60. However, Roman received only $12 for these 3 coins, which is less than their total value. This indicates that the problem statement contains an inconsistency.\n\nHowever, assuming the problem statement is correct and Roman received $12 for 3 gold coins, we can proceed with the calculation.\n\nThe value of 3 gold coins is $60, but Roman received $12, which is 12/60 = 1/5 of the total value. This means that the 3 gold coins he sold are 1/5 of the total number of gold coins he initially had.\n\nLet's set up an equation to represent this:\n\n3 = (1/5)x\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5:\n\n3 * 5 = x\n15 = x\n\nSo, Roman initially had 15 gold coins.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many gold coins he has left after selling 3 coins. To do this, we subtract the number of coins he sold from the initial number of coins:\n\n15 - 3 = 12\n\nTherefore, Roman has 12 gold coins left.",

This means multiplying the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second fraction and vice versa. This gives us: $$(r+3)(r+1) = (r-1)(r-2).$$\n\n### Step 3: Expand both sides of the equation\nWe will now expand both sides of the equation using the distributive property. This gives us: $$r^2 + 3r + r + 3 = r^2 - r - 2r + 2.$$\n\n### Step 4: Simplify both sides of the equation\nWe will now simplify both sides of the equation by combining like terms.

This gives us: $$4r + 3 = -3r + 2.$$\n\n### Step 6: Add $3r$ to both sides of the equation\nTo get all the $r$ terms on one side, we will add $3r$ to both sides of the equation. This gives us: $$7r + 3 = 2.$$\n\n### Step 7: Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation\nTo isolate the term with $r$, we will subtract 3 from both sides of the equation.
